# Determining-Species-of-Iris
In this project, I have used Iris dataset for training and testing. Here, I have used K-nn classification to determine the species of Iris. This is a small attempt of data analysis where the target(i.e. species of Iris) is determined using the features of Iris(such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length & and petal width). I have divided 70% of the dataset for training and the rest for testing. The no. of neighbours I have used for the K-nn classificatio is 6. Also, the knn-score after fitting the test data is 1.
